    <h2 class="policy-section-title">Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      This digital lending library is operated exclusively for the religious and educational
      purposes of the Oratory and its faithful. It exists to provide members with access to
      Catholic theological, spiritual, liturgical, and educational materials in support of
      the mission of the Church.

  {# ── One-Copy, One-Loan ──────────────────────────────────────── #}
  <section class="policy-section">
    <h2 class="policy-section-title">One-Copy, One-Loan Lending Model</h2>
    <p>
      This library follows a controlled digital lending model. For each physical or licensed
      copy of a work owned by the Oratory, only one digital loan may be active at any given
      time. When a copy is on loan to a patron, it is unavailable to other patrons until it
      is returned or the loan period expires. This mirrors the traditional lending practices
      of a physical library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each loaned copy is individually watermarked and time-limited. Upon expiration or
      return, the patron's access to the digital copy is revoked.
    </p>

  <section class="policy-section">
    <h2 class="policy-section-title">Restricted Access</h2>
    <p>
      Access to this library is restricted to registered and approved patrons of the Oratory.
      The catalog and all digital materials are available only to authenticated members. No
      materials are made available to the general public. Registration requires approval by a
      librarian or administrator.
