    <h2 class="policy-section-title">A Living Collection, Sustained by Generosity</h2>
    <p>
      The library of the Oratory exists for the spiritual and intellectual
      enrichment of its faithful. Every volume on our shelves&mdash;whether a
      patristic commentary, a manual of ascetical theology, or a children's
      catechism&mdash;is placed there so that it might form souls in the truth
      and beauty of the Catholic Faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maintaining and growing a collection of this kind is a work of charity.
      Your generosity, whether through the gift of a book or a financial
      contribution, directly sustains this apostolate and ensures that the
      riches of Catholic thought remain accessible to every member of the
      Oratory.

    <p>
      If you possess Catholic works that you believe would benefit the Oratory's
      collection&mdash;works of theology, Sacred Scripture, spirituality,
      Church history, canon law, liturgy, hagiography, or Catholic
      letters&mdash;we warmly welcome your donations. Books in good condition
      may be mailed to:

      A financial gift of any amount helps to ensure the continuity and growth
      of this work.
